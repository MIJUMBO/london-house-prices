## üßÆ Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Filtered data by `London_Borough`, `Year`, and `Average_Price`.
   - Removed missing values and standardized column names.

2. **Function Creation**
   - Defined a function `create_price_ratio()` to calculate the price ratio between 1998 and 2018 for each borough.

3. **Growth Calculation**
   - Defined create_price_ratio by dividing [price_1998/price_2018] across each of London Borough.
   - Computed percentage growth using:  
     Growth\% = (1 / df_ratios['Ratio_2018'] - 1) * 100
     
 4. **Visualization**
   - Created horizontal bar charts to display the top 15 boroughs with the highest growth
